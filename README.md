# VSCode Manual Align

Side bar: probably [this extension](https://github.com/janjoerke/vscode-align-by-regex) is a better version of this :)

## Why another "align" extension?

Almost all of the plugins in the marketplace try to be automatic and detect which characters you want to align on.

I have never found this to be a satisfactory experience, and working across languages and projects I have wanted to a way to be explicit about which lines I am aligning and which character(s) I would like to align on.

This extension requires you to select the lines you want to align, and enter the characters you want to align on.

## Usage

1. Select lines
2. Run command: `align`
3. Enter a string to align on, from 0 to infinte length
4. Watch your lines align
